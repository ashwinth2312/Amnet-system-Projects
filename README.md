-> Backend Processing:
	--> The backend receives the long URL.
	--> A short URL is generated using a URL shortening algorithm (like shortid).
	--> The long URL and short URL are stored in a database or in-memory.
-> Short URL Generation:
	The generated short URL is returned to the user.
->Redirection:
	When a user clicks on the short URL, the server redirects the user to the original long URL.
